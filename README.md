### "Productivity Tricks"

This was inspired by a short podcast episode by Tim Ferris.
Here's the link for those interested: [TODO: LINK]

Why?: I struggle with focus on productivity so I made a tool that would help me. Back when I first listened to this episode (2016 or 2017), it helped. I wouldn't do the post it thing, instead I would just write. Fast forward and I figured why not write a short program, that way I could use it.

What you see now is v1.0. There are some things I want to add to it (see Issues tab) but for now this will do.

Feel free to fork or give me feedback.

Hope this helps you too.
